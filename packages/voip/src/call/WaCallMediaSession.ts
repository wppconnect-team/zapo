/**
 * Milliseconds between two sender reports of one stream. Neither stream kind is
 * paced by a packet count: an audio stream reports once its outgoing RTP
 * timestamp has advanced by this interval expressed in the ticks of its own
 * clock (`intervalMs * clockRate / 1000`, converted once when the stream is
 * created), and a video stream reports on elapsed wall time, whose counter
 * already counts milliseconds.
 *
 * The capture bounds the value instead of pinning it to the tick: across its 28
 * consecutive sender reports the packet count rose by exactly 25 at 960 ticks a
 * packet, which puts the threshold in `23040 < ticks <= 24000` (anything below
 * would have reported on the 24th packet, anything above on the 26th). On the
 * 16 kHz audio clock that is `1440 ms < interval <= 1500 ms`, and 1500 is the
 * one round value inside the band, so a later reading of 1470 would agree with
 * this rather than contradict it.
 *
 * The 16 kHz itself comes from the media clock, not from arrival times: the
 * capture holds codec buffer contents and carries no arrival timestamps at all.
 * It follows from the packetization, 960 ticks per 60 ms packet, and from the
 * per-subframe reading of another capture, 960 ticks over 60 ms.
 *
 * Only the mechanism is proven in the binary. The observed 1500 ms is neither
 * the compiled default (1000 ms, which would close in 17 packets, not 25) nor
 * the fallback (4500 to 5499 ms): the only path that writes the field reads the
 * `rtcp_interval_ms` parameter the server hands down in `<voip_settings>`. The
 * That node is parsed now, but it ships two profiles and only the audio one
 * carries `rc.rtcp_interval_ms`, where it is exactly 1500. A video call never
 * receives the key, so this compiled constant is what actually runs there. The
 * two numbers matching is a coincidence, not a design: the 1500 came from a
 * capture, not from this parameter, so changing it silently moves the real
 * interval of every video call while leaving audio calls untouched.

 *
 * The packet is `[12 bytes of RTP][parity]`, with the SSRC, sequence and

 * assembly: the first parity byte having `& 0x1f` equal to 5, one chance in

 * while the SSRC of the FEC slot depends on deriving the device jid of the peer
 * - the derivation the session already corrects at runtime when the SSRC that

     *
     * Called from the send path once the stream's own schedule says the report
     * interval has closed. `rtpTimestamp` is the timestamp of the packet that
     * closed it, taken from the stream itself, so the report stays on the
     * stream's clock instead of extrapolating wall time.

     * `whatsappVideoProfile` separates the two callers: the video path turns
     * WhatsApp's profile bit on in byte 0 of the sender report, taking it to
     * 0x91, and the audio one stays on the canonical byte. Only this send path
     * knows which stream the report belongs to, so the distinction comes down
     * from here as a parameter instead of being deduced from the SSRC further
     * down.
     *
     * The block count and the trailer stay as the builder defines them: the
     * count derived from `packetCount`, which is already monotonic per call, and
     * the form with a trailer, which is the one of the one-to-one call this

    /**
     * Emits a REMB when the reception interval closes, announcing to the peer
     * the bitrate this end estimates it can receive - capacity, not the rate
     * that is arriving. The value becomes the ceiling of the estimator of the
     * sender, so handing back what arrives would lock the call in the collapsed
     * state.
     *
     * Called from the receive path, per video packet, and not from the send
     * path: that is the difference that matters. The video sender report only
     * goes out from inside the send path, so on a call where we receive video
     * without sending, no video feedback leaves this end. The REMB does not
     * inherit that - it goes out for as long as video is arriving, with or
     * without video going out, because it is the estimate of the receiver and
     * what feeds it is precisely the reception.
     *
     * `mediaSsrc` is the SSRC that came in the received packet, the same one the
     * key frame request addresses, and not the precomputed SSRC of the peer: the
     * session already corrects the derivation at runtime when what arrives does
     * not match the list, so what is on the wire is the only source that cannot
     * diverge.
     *
     * The per-packet cost is one addition and one subtraction; the rest only
     * runs on the packet that closes the interval.
     *
     * `vid_rc.disable_rtcp_remb` in the offer cancels the send. The server turns
     * that feedback transport off per call, and a REMB emitted anyway is a
     * correct packet the peer does not process - which is exactly what happened
     * before the session read the configuration. Only the send is conditional:
     * the ceiling is computed and stored before the gate, on purpose, because it
     * does not belong to RTCP. What also reads it is the video RTP header
     * extension, and it is precisely on the calls where the server turns the
     * REMB off that this other transport is the only one left - leaving the
     * computation behind the gate would keep it stuck at zero exactly where it
     * matters.

 * Milliseconds between two sender reports of one stream. Neither stream kind is

 * timestamp has advanced by this interval expressed in the ticks of its own
 * clock (`intervalMs * clockRate / 1000`, converted once when the stream is
 * created), and a video stream reports on elapsed wall time, whose counter
 * already counts milliseconds.
 *
 * The capture bounds the value instead of pinning it to the tick: across its 28
 * consecutive sender reports the packet count rose by exactly 25 at 960 ticks a
 * packet, which puts the threshold in `23040 < ticks <= 24000` (anything below
 * would have reported on the 24th packet, anything above on the 26th). On the
 * 16 kHz audio clock that is `1440 ms < interval <= 1500 ms`, and 1500 is the
 * one round value inside the band, so a later reading of 1470 would agree with
 * this rather than contradict it.
 *
 * The 16 kHz itself comes from the media clock, not from arrival times: the
 * capture holds codec buffer contents and carries no arrival timestamps at all.
 * It follows from the packetization, 960 ticks per 60 ms packet, and from the
 * per-subframe reading of another capture, 960 ticks over 60 ms.
 *
 * An audio call runs the server's `rc.rtcp_interval_ms` (1500) from the plan's
 * settings instead; a video call never gets that key, so this default runs there.

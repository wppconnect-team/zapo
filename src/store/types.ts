     * **Single-writer assumption:** the L1 is per-process and has no

     * the persistent domains.
     *
     * Only the four domains below are exposed. The other persistent domains
     * are deliberately excluded, each for a verified reason:
     * - `signal`: the per-send `getRegistrationInfo` read is already memoized
     *   write-through inside the signal lock (`signal.lock.ts`), and the
     *   remaining reads (`getSignedPreKey`/`getSignedPreKeyById`/rotation ts)
     *   change only on the rare signed-prekey rotation and fire on inbound
     *   session-init, not per message - a second cache would add nothing.
     * - `appState`: the sync client already caches collection state for the
     *   sync-context lifetime, the only scope where reads both repeat and stay
     *   coherent. Across sync cycles the version is incremented and persisted,
     *   so a persistent cache yields ~0 hits, and the version is sent on the
     *   wire (server-authoritative) - a stale one forces a refetch loop.
     * - `preKey`: one-time prekeys are read exactly once then consumed
     *   (deleted) on the inbound path, so there is nothing to re-read; serving
     *   a consumed prekey from a stale cache would reuse a one-time key and
     *   break forward secrecy. There is no safe, useful read here.
     * - `auth` is loaded once per connect and kept in memory; the mailbox
     *   domains (`messages`/`threads`/`contacts`) are cold, large reads off
     *   the crypto path with write-behind already; and the cache domains
     *   (retry/groupMetadata/deviceList/messageSecret) default to in-process
     *   memory already, so an L1 in front would be a cache over a cache.
